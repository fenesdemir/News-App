# news_app

A new Flutter project.

# Important!

If you ever get the error "Cannot run with sound null safety because dependencies don't support null safety";

    In your IDE of choice, you can use:
    
      In IntelliJ/Android Studio: "Edit Configurations" (in your run configurations) → "Additional run args"
      
      In Visual Studio Code: search for "Flutter run additional args" in your user settings
      
      In both cases, add "--no-sound-null-safety" command without quotation marks.

# Önemli!

Eğer "Cannot run with sound null safety because dependencies don't support null safety" hatsı alırsanız:

    Kullandığınız IDE'de:
    
      IntelliJ/Android Studio için: "Edit Configurations" kısmında ("run configurations" kısmının altında) → "Additional run args" kısmına,
      
      Visual Studio Code için: Kullanıcı ayarları ksımında "Flutter run additional args" kısmına,
      
      "--no-sound-null-safety" komutunu (tırnak işaretleri olmadan) ekleyin
